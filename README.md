### Basics

Under the `_data` folder there are three files: pages, settings and social.
In pages you can add other pages that will show up in the nav-
In social you can add your socials that will show up in the nav. To add a social, find a suitable icon on [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and add it's name in the name tag.
Brand defines Font Awesome's font type (fas is solid, fab is brand).
Out of the box this theme has support colors for a bunch of social. If your social isn't supported, just add the color in the header.css 

In `_data/settings.yml` you can activate or deactivate various functions of the theme, like analytics, disqus comments, related posts and so on.

### Typography
By default YAMT uses the System Font STack, which greatly reduces load times. If you want to use the old Font Stack, in `assets/main.scss` change `typography` to `typography-old`.

### Header
In `_data/settings.yml` you can choose to hide or show the subtitle, the page navigation or the social icons.

### Home
In `_data/settings.yml` you can choose to hide or show the posts infos (date and read-time) and the featured image.

### Post
In `_data/settings.yml` you can choose to hide or show the post infos, categories, related posts and comments.
Note that by removing categories the Categories Archives will no longer be reachable.
